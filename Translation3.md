Erechtheus, son of Pandion, had four daughters. At that time, Eumolpius, son of Neptune, came and attacked Athens, but was defeated. Neptune, who was angry that his son was killed by Erechtheus, said "Erechtheus' daughter will be sacrificed." therefore Chthonia, one of his daughters, was sacrificed. Her other sisters killed themselves; ad Erechtheus was struck by a lightning bolt.
