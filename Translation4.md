when The Greeks could not capture Troy for ten years, Epeus made a wooden horse or amazing size. In it, he gathered Menelus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, and Neoptolemus. And it was written on the horse "A gift to Minerva From the Greeks", to be taken to Tenedo's military camp. When they saw the Trojans, they judged that the enemy had gone away; Priam ordered the horse into the temple of Minerva. when the prophet, Cassandra, Said the horse was from the enemy, Faith was not given and the horse was not placed in the temple. The Greeks came out of the gates and killed the guards and conquered Troy.
